# Doodle Defender

Refactored from doodle_defender_v8.html. Open index.html directly in a modern browser. No installation or build required. Keep the folder together.

## Editing guide

- game.js composes systems and starts the game.
- js/state.js owns mutable run state and initial values.
- js/dom.js binds canvas and HUD elements.
- js/loop.js owns timing and simulation updates.
- js/renderer.js draws the original canvas artwork and handles resizing.
- js/enemies.js handles enemy creation, Steve, projectiles, and eraser attacks.
- js/waves.js handles run reset, wave progression, victory, and game over.
- js/walls.js handles drawing costs, wall durability, ink contact, and synergy combat effects.
- js/upgrades.js owns upgrade and synergy definitions and selection.
- js/ui.js updates the HUD and synergy splash.
- js/input.js owns pointer drawing and button/resize event wiring.
- js/effects.js creates particles and floating text.
- js/geometry.js contains math and intersection helpers.
- styles.css preserves the original layout and appearance.

Each system is a factory receiving the same game context. Mutable values live in game.state; DOM references in game.dom; upgrade tables in game.catalog. game.api connects systems without implicit shared variables. System methods are also grouped on game.renderer, game.walls, etc. Install every system before starting the loop.

This is a behavior-preserving first structural pass. The central simulation still coordinates interactions in loop.js; those can be extracted independently in future edits. Artwork remains procedural canvas drawing because v8 supplies no separate image assets. Best-wave storage retains the original doodleDefenderBestV4 key.

## Validation

All JavaScript files were syntax checked. The supplied validation harness checks browser startup, run reset, pointer drawing, ink accounting, upgrade selection, pause/resume, and simulation/rendering against the original using deterministic randomness.

Run `node tests/validate.cjs` to repeat the deterministic comparison. The original v8 source is included only as a test fixture. The harness uses a simulated DOM/canvas; it does not replace a visual check in a real browser.
